I decided to build my first app with Android just to have some fun and knowledges about the mobile develomping. After first Android manual
I decided go to the next level and create small game. And now I will show you what I have done in couple hours or maybe 5 :).

## Story
I tried React Native - cool, fast but do not have expirience with Natibe I decided to search for something else. And I remembered that 
Java is in use in Android based app and games. 

### What I have done
I spend couple hours in morning and couple hours in evening. What I have now:

Yeah its basic and light but I'm planning to extend the game with game framework and add sounds and images.
And also maybe add AI to the computer game choices. So will see :smile:
